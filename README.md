Welcome to the source code of my own [personal website](https://dafnamargalit.com)!

I created this website using [React](https://reactjs.org/), a component-based JavaScript library that allowed me to efficiently create a cool multi-page website!

# Packages Used

I used the following packages while creating this website, using the yarn package installer:

1. [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) (obviously)
2. [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
3. [react-loader-spinner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loader-spinner)

# Deployment

In order to deploy this website and host it, I used Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) hosting services, which are free!

# Running it on your own

You want to use this code? No problem! 

Install the necessary dependencies (yarn, react), and then run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/dafnamargalit/dafna.git

cd dafna

yarn install

yarn start
```

Run `yarn run build` after creating any changes you want to see in your build!
